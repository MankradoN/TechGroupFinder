## Usage

### Updating configuration

The project is configured via a JSON [config file](src/config/engine.json).  If you would like to make configuration changes, there is no need to regenerate this app from your App Search Dashboard. Additional configuration can be made by modifying that file.

You can simply open up the
[engine.json](src/config/engine.json) file, update the [options](#config),
and then restart this app.

### Configuration options <a id="config"></a>

The following is a complete list of options available for configuration in [engine.json](src/config/engine.json).

### If you are checking this project out directly from GitHub... <a id="github"></a>

You can follow the previous steps, but then you will need to create and configure
[engine.json](src/config/engine.json).

To do so, make a copy of [engine.json.example](src/config/engine.json.example),
rename it to `engine.json` and configure it with your Engine's specific details.

```bash
cp src/config/engine.json.example src/config/engine.json
```
